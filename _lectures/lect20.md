TOPICS
* Python Basics
    * Types
        * int, float, boolean, strings, lists, sets, dictionaries,
        * conversion functions (int(), float(), str(), ...)
        * Mutable vs. Immutable
    * Relational / Logical Operators (==, <, <=, >, >=, and, or, not, ...)
    * Python Lists
        * Supporting methods (count, pop, ...)
    * Understand under-the-hood functionality of lists vs. dictionaries
    * List / String slicing [x:y]
    * Strings
        * Supporting methods (replace, split, find, ...)
    * Function definitions
    * Control structures
        * if, else, elif, for, while
* Testing
    * Test Driven Development (TDD)
    * pytests
* Python Errors
    * Syntax vs. Runtime error
* Exceptions
    * Exception types (NameError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError, ...)
    * Exception handling (try / except / raise)
        * try / except / raise
        * Flow of execution
        * Passing exceptions to function/method caller
        * Catching multiple types of exceptions
        * Catching inherited type exceptions
* Object Oriented Programming
    * Defining Python classes and methods
    * Class constructors
        * Defining / initializing default parameters
    * Shallow vs. Deep Equality
        * overloading the __eq__ method
    * Overloading operators
        * __str__, __add__, __le__, __ge__, __lt__, __gt__, ...
    * Inheritance
        * Know the implementation and inheritance of fields / methods, and
        how to override inherited methods
        * Know the pattern on how to construct inherited classes
        * KNow the hierarchy of types (how this affects excpetion handling)
        * How how to explicitly call super / base class(es)' methods
* Algorithm Analysis and O-notation
    * Know how to derive the O-notation from a time function for various
    data structures and code segments
* Binary Search
    * Search for items in a SORTED list
    * Know the implementation and O-notation
* Recursion
    * Understand how recursive algorithms are managed by the call stack
    * Able to derive O-notation for various recursive functions
* Linear Data Structures
    * Know implementations (as covered in textbook/lectures) and O-ntation
    for various functionality of data structures
        * Stacks, Queues, Deques, Linked Lists, Ordered Linked Lists
* Sorting Algorithms
    * Know the implementation and O-notation analysis (best and worst-cases)
    of various sorting algorithms
        * Bubble Sort (including the optimized version), Selection Sort,
        Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort
* Trees
    * Terminology
    * Binary Heaps: Know min-heap / max-heap data structure implementation
    (and the underlying list representation)
    * Binary Trees
        * know the nodes and references implementation
        * Tree traversals: pre, in, and post order traversals
    * Binary Search Trees
        * BST property and how insertion order affects the structure
        * Know various BST methods (put, get, delete)
